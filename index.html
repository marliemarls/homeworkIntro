        My name is Marlie and I am from Brooklyn, NY. My journey in tech began in the myspace days, when I learned how to make my font blue, and in italics. Though it didn't really take off until a couple years ago when I took a pre-bootcamp course with FullStack Academy. Although I didn't end up going through the FullStack Bootcamp, I did continue learning about web development on my own time.

        Last year, I had the opportunity to be a Web Development Fellow at The Knowledge House, located in the Bronx. I really enjoyed the fellowship, mostly because I had an amazing instructor and TA that helped me really understand the content. Now I am a Jr Software Developer, working in the Bronx for PeopleShores & Accenture. While I still have a long journey ahead of me, full of much to learn, I am excited about where I am today and grateful for the opportunity to be here.
